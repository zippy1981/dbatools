        .SYNOPSIS
            Returns a bunch of information from dm_exec_connections.

        .DESCRIPTION
            Returns a bunch of information from dm_exec_connections which, according to Microsoft:
            "Returns information about the connections established to this instance of SQL Server and the details of each connection. Returns server wide connection information for SQL Server. Returns current database connection information for SQL Database."
    
        .PARAMETER SqlInstance
            The target SQL Server instance. Server(s) must be SQL Server 2005 or higher.

        .PARAMETER SqlCredential
            Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Windows and SQL Authentication supported. Accepts credential objects (Get-Credential)

        .PARAMETER EnableException
            By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
            This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
            Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
